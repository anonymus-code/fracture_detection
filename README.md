# Bone Fracture Detection API

This FastAPI project provides a simple API for predicting bone fractures in X-ray images using a pre-trained machine learning model.

## Overview

The project uses a TensorFlow-based neural network for image classification. The pre-trained model takes an X-ray image as input and predicts whether the bone is fractured or not.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anonymus-code/fracture_detection
